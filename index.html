                <p>
                My name is Marion Poljakov, and I am nineteen years old.</p> 

                <p> Currently, I am studying to become a Junior Software    Engineer, who specializes in web development in Tartu Vocational College. Before that I majored in Economics in secondary school, from which I graduated with a gold medal.</p>

                <p>I chose to study software engineering since I have always been quite fascinated by technology at a young age, and I started to learn programming properly at the end of my secondary school where I learnt how to do some minor things in C++, but it all came to me so easily that I even tried to learn some more during my free time. I do not have any prior work experience, but I am very eager to grow and learn new things.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, during my time off from studying I like to make crochet projects, it is calming and gives me time to rewind. I make sure to stay in shape both physically and mentally by doing sports indoors and outdoors. One of my long-term hobbies has been singing. It has taught me how to be consistent with appearances.</p>
                <p>Since I figured out what to do not that long ago, I do not have many accomplishments in software engineering. However, so far, I have taken part of one competition which showed me how intense and fascinating coding is.
